_**`StudentTracker`**_ is a **student-tracking app / school administration platform**. It is a simulation of a real-world system design, that balances **core features** (must-haves) with **concepts** (good software design principles).

## 🔑 Core Features to Consider

### 1. **Student Management**

* Add / update / remove student records
* Profiles with personal info, contact details, guardian info
* Enrollment history (classes, grades, status)

### 2. **Class & Course Management**

* Create courses, assign teachers, set schedules
* Manage subjects per grade level
* Handle prerequisites or co-requisites

### 3. **Attendance Tracking**

* Daily attendance logs (present/absent/late)
* Attendance reports per student/class

### 4. **Grades & Assessments**

* Record test scores, assignments, and exams
* GPA/grade calculation
* Progress reports / report cards

### 5. **Teacher & Staff Management**

* Profiles (subjects taught, schedule, contact)
* Role-based accounts (admin, teacher, student, parent)

### 6. **Communication**

* Notifications for parents/students (SMS/email/in-app)
* Announcements (school-wide or class-specific)

### 7. **Fee & Payment Tracking**

* Tuition and fee invoicing
* Payment records, balances, and receipts

### 8. **Reports & Analytics**

* Performance dashboards (attendance %, average grade)
* Export to Excel/PDF for admin reporting

## ⚙️ Concepts to Keep in Mind

### 1. **Data Modeling**

* Design clean **entity relationships**: Student ↔ Classes ↔ Teachers ↔ Grades
* Think in terms of **relational DB schemas** (if SQL) or **document structures** (if NoSQL)

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization**

* Role-based access:

    * **Admin** → Full control
    * **Teacher** → Class & grade access
    * **Student/Parent** → Read-only view of grades/attendance

### 3. **Scalability & Maintainability**

* Separate **modules** (student, classes, grades, finance)
* Use an **API layer** if you want a mobile/web hybrid later

### 4. **Audit Trail & Security**

* Log changes to student records (who updated what)
* Secure sensitive info (encrypt passwords, hash data)

### 5. **User Experience**

* Simple dashboards
* Search & filtering (find student by ID, class, or name)
* Responsive UI (mobile & desktop)

---

## 🚀 Bonus (Advanced Ideas)

* **Parent Portal**: Parents can log in to check attendance, grades, and fees
* **Timetable Generator**: Auto-generate class schedules to avoid conflicts
* **AI Suggestions**: Predict at-risk students based on attendance + performance
* **Integrations**: Export reports to Google Sheets, sync with email/SMS APIs

---
